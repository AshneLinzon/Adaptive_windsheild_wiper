# ADAPTIVE WINDSHIELD WIPER SYSTEM
 This project is an *ADAPTIVE WINDSHIELD WIPER SYSTEM* using *STM32F103C8T6* microcontroller. 
 It adjust wiper speed based on rain intensity detected through an ADC rain sensor and logs data using UART.
# COMPONENTS
   -> STM32F103C8T6 Microcontroller
    ->ADC Rain Sensor
    ->DC Motor(wiper)
    ->LED (rain status indicator)
    ->UART for data logging
    ->visual terminal (to display the rain intensity is low or high)
# PROJECT STRUCTURE
  -> hardware: Circuit diagrams,schematics,components list
  -> software: Source code for STM32,UART logs
